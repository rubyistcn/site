Jekyll 是一款基于 Ruby 构建的静态网站生成系统，它通过 Ruby 内核和 Liquid 模板系统构建了动态管理、静态输出的网站系统。文章内容使用 Markdown 格式编写，通过元数据构建必要的数据网络。下面是 Jekyll 的默认输出网站，默认的主题使用的是 `minimal`。

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
